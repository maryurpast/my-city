                Vinnytsia Water Tower (1912)

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                A very picturesque historic brick building 28 meters high
                standing on European Square. In the past, this water tower was
                also used as a fire tower, for which the upper tier was adapted.
                After World War II, the tower lost its original purpose and was
                converted into a residential building. The families of workers
                of the city water utility lived in it. In 1985, the tower was
                reconstructed and became a branch of the Vinnytsia Local History
                Museum. In 2000, according to the decision of the Vinnytsia city
                council, the tower was included in the list of city symbols. You
                can climb to the top of the tower and enjoy the views of
                Vinnytsia.
